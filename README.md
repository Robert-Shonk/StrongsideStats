The goal is to show player match history in addition to presenting stats that can be improved.

Starting out I'd like to calculate the typical stats such as CS/min, gold/min, champion damage/death, etc.

Also I'd like to present "lesser appreciated" stats such as average ward score over a certain amount of games, average turret damage, level/experience differences, etc.
